# Sigmund Freud

**Sigmund Freud** (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of *psychoanalysis*, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. His work profoundly shaped psychology, literature, art, and popular culture.

Born in Freiberg, Moravia (now Příbor in the Czech Republic), Freud studied medicine at the University of Vienna. He initially worked in neurology but gradually shifted toward the psychological dimensions of mental illness. In the 1890s, he developed the *talking cure*—a process of verbal therapy that laid the groundwork for modern psychoanalysis.

Freud spent most of his professional life in [Vienna](./vienna.md), where he developed the foundations of psychoanalysis.

Freud introduced several influential theories, including the **unconscious mind**, **psychosexual development**, and the **structural model of the psyche** (id, ego, and superego). He believed that unconscious desires and childhood experiences deeply influence adult behavior. His 1900 book, *The Interpretation of Dreams*, is considered one of his most important works, proposing that dreams are a form of wish fulfillment. 

Despite his lasting impact, Freud's theories have been subject to intense criticism and revision. Many concepts, such as the Oedipus complex or penis envy, have been challenged for their lack of empirical support. Nevertheless, Freud's emphasis on inner conflict and the complexity of the human mind continues to inform various schools of psychotherapy and cultural theory.

Freud fled Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938 and spent his final years in London, where he died in 1939.
