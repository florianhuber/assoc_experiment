# Vienna

**Vienna** is the capital of Austria and one of Europe's most culturally rich cities. Known for its imperial history, stunning architecture, and classical music heritage, Vienna has long been a center of intellectual and artistic innovation.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Vienna was the epicenter of a flourishing intellectual movement that included figures like Gustav Klimt, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and **Sigmund Freud**. Freud lived and worked in Vienna for most of his life, and it was here that he developed his theories of the unconscious and psychoanalysis.

Visitors to Vienna can explore the **Sigmund Freud Museum**, located in Freudâ€™s former residence at Berggasse 19. The museum provides insight into Freud's life and work and preserves the atmosphere of early psychoanalytic practice.

Vienna remains a global city with a high quality of life, consistently ranking among the most livable cities in the world. Its coffeehouse culture, grand boulevards, and vibrant arts scene make it a favorite destination for tourists and scholars alike.
